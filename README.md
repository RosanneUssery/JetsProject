All ASCII art has been obtained from: <a href = "http://www.ascii-art.de/">ASCII Art Dictionary</a>

To Do:
* User Story #6 - Each jet has a pilot
* User Story #7 - Assign a random pilot to each jet that is created
* User Story #8 - Users can hire pilots
* User Story #9 - Whenever a jet's information is displayed, that jet's pilot and their information should also be displayed
* Format output so it looks cool.
